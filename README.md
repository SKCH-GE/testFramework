# Automated Test Framework

An intelligent test automation framework utilizing Jinja2 templating for seamless sensor integration testing and validation. Originally developed as part of a larger project, this framework now stands as an independent testing solution.

## Overview

This framework automates the testing process for sensor integration, focusing on validating system compatibility, data workflows, and technical requirements. Built with BDD (Behavior Driven Development) principles, it leverages Gherkin syntax and pytest to create maintainable and scalable test suites.

## Features

### Core Capabilities
- **Sensor Integration Testing**: Automated validation of new sensor implementations
- **Conflict Detection**: Proactive identification of technical conflicts between system components
- **Data Workflow Simulation**: End-to-end testing of data processing pipelines
- **Template-Based Test Generation**: Utilizes Jinja2 for efficient test script creation

### Key Benefits
- Simplified test creation process
- Reusable test templates
- Standardized testing methodology
- Reduced manual testing effort

## Technology Stack

- Python
- Pytest
- Jinja2 Templating Engine
- Gherkin/BDD Framework

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install required packages
pip install pytest
pip install jinja2
```

### Basic Usage

1. Define your test scenarios in Gherkin syntax:
```gherkin
Feature: Sensor Integration
    Scenario: New sensor data validation
        Given a new sensor is connected
        When data is received
        Then verify data format matches specification
```

2. Create test templates using Jinja2:
```python
# Example template structure
{% for sensor in sensors %}
def test_{{ sensor.name }}_integration():
    assert verify_sensor_connection('{{ sensor.id }}')
{% endfor %}
```

3. Run the test suite:
```bash
pytest test_sensors.py
```

## Use Cases

- Integration testing of new sensors
- Validation of sensor data workflows
- System compatibility verification
- Automated regression testing

## Best Practices

1. **Template Organization**
   - Keep templates modular and focused
   - Use clear naming conventions
   - Document template parameters

2. **Test Structure**
   - Follow BDD principles
   - Write clear, descriptive scenarios
   - Maintain consistent formatting

3. **Test Generation**
   - Validate generated tests
   - Keep generated tests separate from templates
   - Version control both templates and generated tests
